Medical Appointment Booking App is a website that allows patients to search for doctors by speciality, to book appointments, and to review the services they received.

### Technologies

The App is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React.JS

### Installation

- Fork and clone the repository on your local machine
- Run the command 'npm init' to install dependencies

- Open the application in browser on the specified port

### Run the App

Start two terminal windows, and in each terminal write the following commands:

- React App Terminal:

-- Run your React app using 'npm run client' or 'react-scripts start' from the react app folder.
-- This starts the development server for your React application.

- Node.js Server Terminal:

-- Navigate to the server folder. Run your Node.js server using 'node server/server.js' or 'npm run server' if you have a script in your package.json file.
-- This starts your Node.js server that handles backend logic and APIs.

- MongoDB Terminal:

-- Start your MongoDB server using the mongod command, if you installed MongoDB on your machine. Otherwise, use MongoDB Atlas and create a .env flle to store the database server link. Add the .env file to .gitignore.
